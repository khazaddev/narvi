// Package identitylink is the I/O-performing orchestrator for §13.2's
// auto-link algorithm and its magic-link counterpart -- the app-layer
// half of §13.2's ("identities + full RBAC") own auto-linking brief,
// paired with the pure decision logic in internal/domain/identitylink
// (see that package's own doc.go for the exact domain/app split, mirroring
// internal/domain/turn vs internal/app/sessionactor).
//
// # Resolve -- §13.2's own numbered algorithm, steps 1-4
//
// Called by internal/adapters/inbound/{slack,linear} at the point where an
// inbound event names a provider identity (a Slack user id, a Linear
// creatorId) this codebase has never seen before:
//
//  1. Fetch the actor's profile email from the provider API -- this is
//     the CALLER's own job (internal/adapters/outbound/{slackapi,linearapi}.
//     GetUserEmail, wrapped in platform.Retry by the caller), NOT this
//     package's -- Resolve itself takes the already-fetched (email, ok)
//     pair, since retrying is provider-specific (a different client, a
//     different auth token shape) while everything AFTER a successful
//     fetch is identical regardless of which provider asked. ok=false
//     means every retry already failed; Resolve does nothing further at
//     all in that case (no guess, no prompt -- §13.2's own failure rule:
//     "never null-out an email on transient failure" -- this simply skips
//     the whole attempt rather than writing anything).
//  2. Match against users.primary_email (postgres.UserStore.
//     GetByPrimaryEmail) and verified identities.email (postgres.
//     IdentityStore.ListVerifiedUserIDsByEmail), deduplicated by user id.
//  3. internal/domain/identitylink.Decide renders the pure verdict.
//  4. Exactly one match: INSERT the identities row (linked_via=auto_email)
//     and an audit_log row, in ONE transaction, then delete any
//     still-pending link prompt for this same identity (a later,
//     resolved auto-link supersedes an earlier "we couldn't tell"
//     prompt). Zero or multiple matches: reuse a still-unexpired
//     identity_link_prompts row if one already exists for this
//     (provider, external_id) (never re-mint/re-send a magic link on
//     every single inbound message -- see this package's own service.go
//     for the concrete policy), otherwise mint a fresh nonce
//     (platform.GenerateToken, hashed at rest exactly like user_sessions/
//     ws_tokens already do) and persist it.
//
// Either way, Resolve NEVER blocks the calling ingress flow on any of
// this (§13.2's own explicit "the action proceeds with bot attribution
// until linked") -- its own Resolution.UserID stays invalid (Valid ==
// false) for every branch except the exactly-one-match case, so the
// caller's own turn/session/plan-decision write proceeds with bot
// attribution exactly as it always did, EXCEPT now carrying the real
// user id the moment an auto-link (or an earlier one, already on file)
// resolves it.
//
// In-channel/in-app notification (§13.2 step 3's own "notify the user
// in-channel and in-app") is split across two owners, deliberately: the
// IN-CHANNEL half (posting a Slack/Linear message) is the CALLER's job --
// Resolve returns a Resolution the caller inspects (AutoLinked /
// MagicLinkURL) and acts on with its own channel-specific client, mirroring
// how internal/app/identitylink never imports slackapi/linearapi itself
// (this package stays provider-agnostic, exactly like domain/identitylink
// does). The IN-APP half is realized via the audit_log row itself,
// surfaced through the members API's own audit-log read endpoint
// (internal/adapters/inbound/httpapi/members.go) -- there is no separate
// notifications/inbox subsystem in this codebase yet (confirmed: no
// migration, no domain package; Phase 7 is the first UI Step at all), so
// building one from scratch is explicitly out of THIS Step's scope; the
// audit trail is the one "in-app, durable, queryable" surface that
// already exists and already needs an auto-link entry regardless.
//
// # Consume -- the magic-link counterpart (§13.2 step 4's own "connect
// your account" link)
//
// Called by internal/adapters/inbound/identitylink's own magic-link
// consume HTTP handler, once the clicking visitor is authenticated (a
// valid narvi_auth_session cookie -- that package's own handler redirects
// through the existing GitHub OAuth login first if not, see its own doc
// comment): validates the presented nonce (exists, not expired), inserts
// the identities row (linked_via=prompt, user_id = the now-authenticated
// user), records the audit-log entry (THIS time with a real, human
// actor_user_id -- the person who clicked their own confirmed link), and
// deletes every pending prompt for that same (provider, external_id) so a
// stale link can never be replayed.
