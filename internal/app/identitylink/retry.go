// counter records ONLY the case where every attempt genuinely failed
// TRANSIENTLY and attempts were exhausted ("the fetch itself is broken",
// an operationally actionable signal) -- see FetchEmailWithRetry's own doc
// comment for the exact line this distinction is drawn on. Labeled by
// provider (attribute "provider", sqlcgen.IdentityProvider's own string

// distinguishable in the metric itself, since both providers share this
// one package's own FetchEmailWithRetry.

// Audit fix ("the Warn log/counter fire on a normal, expected 'user not
// found' outcome, diluting the 'broken fetch' signal"): a
// platform.Permanent-wrapped error -- slackapi.ErrSlackUserNotFound,
// wrapped by internal/adapters/inbound/slack/identity.go's own
// resolveSlackActor closure, or its exact Linear-side counterpart,
// linearapi.ErrLinearUserNotFound, wrapped by internal/adapters/inbound/
// linear/identity.go's own resolveActor closure -- for a provider user id
// that no longer resolves (a deactivated/deleted account, or an old/
// redelivered webhook event referencing a user who's since left the
// workspace) is a normal, expected, NON-actionable outcome -- routine
// workspace member churn, not evidence the profile-email fetch API itself
// is broken. FetchEmailWithRetry below now excludes this case from both
// the Warn log and this counter, for EITHER provider.
//
// Constructed once, as a package-level var, rather than through a
// NewBuilder-style fallible constructor (outboxworker.NewBuilder/
// sessionactor.NewRegistry/reconciler.NewReconciler's own established
// "construct once, at process-construction time, via otel.Meter(meterName)"
// pattern): unlike those packages, identitylink has no long-lived,
// process-constructed object of its own to hang this counter off of --
// FetchEmailWithRetry and Resolve are free functions, called directly off
// a platform.Timeouts/Deps value built via a plain struct literal at every
// one of this package's own several call sites (cmd/control-plane/main.go's
// production wiring AND roughly ten existing test files across this
// package and internal/adapters/inbound/{slack,linear}) -- threading a
// NEW, fallible NewXxx constructor through all of them, for a change this
// narrow, would ripple far past what this finding actually needs.
// otel.Meter is documented safe to call before platform.SetupOTel ever
// registers the real, globally-configured MeterProvider (go.opentelemetry.
// io/otel's own package doc: "It is also unnecessary to wait until the
// MeterProvider is configured to create Meters... still valid after") --
// every meter/instrument obtained from the global provider before that
// point is transparently upgraded in place the moment
// otel.SetMeterProvider runs, so this package-level var still ends up
// recording against the exact SAME real MeterProvider cmd/control-plane/
// main.go configures for every other instrument in this codebase, with no
// explicit wiring required at any of this package's own call sites.

// FetchEmailWithRetry wraps platform.Retry around fetch -- ONE provider-

// slackapi.Client.GetUserEmail / internal/adapters/outbound/linearapi.
// Client.GetUserEmail, each already threaded with whatever provider-
// specific auth/lookup they individually need by the caller's own
// closure) -- using timeouts.IdentityEmailFetch* to configure both the
// attempt count/backoff AND a per-attempt deadline (§13.2: "a provider
// email-API failure is a retryable error... retry with backoff").
//
// Centralized here (rather than duplicated once per ingress package)
// since the retry POLICY itself (how many attempts, how long to wait,
// how long one attempt gets) is entirely provider-agnostic -- only the
// fetch closure itself differs between Slack and Linear. provider (the
// SAME sqlcgen.IdentityProvider constant the caller passes into Resolve
// right after this call) and logger are used ONLY for the M19 audit-fix
// observability below -- they change nothing about the retry behavior
// itself.
//
// email/ok mirrors Resolve's own (email string, emailOK bool) parameter
// shape exactly: ok=false covers BOTH "every retry attempt failed" and "a
// retry succeeded but reported no email at all" (fetch's own second
// return value) -- Resolve treats both identically (§13.2's own "never
// null-out an email on transient failure" rule means neither case should
// ever be treated as a confirmed empty identity, just "we don't know
// right now").
//
// M19 audit fix ("a permanently broken provider email-fetch API disables
// auto-link platform-wide in total silence"): ok=false's two cases above
// are IDENTICAL for Resolve's own purposes, by design, but must be told
// apart for OBSERVABILITY -- and, per the follow-up audit fix below, a
// THIRD case must also be told apart from the first:
//
//  1. Every retry attempt failed with a genuine, TRANSIENT error and
//     platform.Retry exhausted every attempt (below) -- "the fetch itself
//     is broken". Logged at Warn (provider + the real underlying error)
//     and counted by emailFetchFailures above -- an operationally
//     actionable signal a permanently broken Slack/Linear profile-email
//     API would otherwise disable auto-linking platform-wide with zero
//     trace anywhere.
//  2. A fetch attempt SUCCEEDED (platform.Retry returns nil) but the
//     provider's own API genuinely reported no email for this user
//     (fetch's own second return value, ok, is false) -- "the user simply
//     has no email on file", a normal, expected, non-actionable outcome.
//     Deliberately NEITHER logged NOR counted: doing so would defeat the
//     entire point of this distinction, burying the one actionable signal
//     (case 1) under routine noise from case 2, which is expected to be
//     common and is not, by itself, ever a sign of anything broken.
//  3. Audit fix ("the Warn log/counter fire on a normal, expected 'user
//     not found' outcome"): the fetch closure itself positively identified
//     the failure as PERMANENT (platform.Permanent -- slackapi.
//     ErrSlackUserNotFound, or linearapi.ErrLinearUserNotFound, for a
//     provider user id that no longer resolves -- a deactivated/deleted
//     account, or an old/redelivered webhook event referencing a user
//     who's since left the workspace).
//     platform.Retry stops immediately on this and returns the WRAPPED
//     error unchanged (see that function's own doc comment) -- from the
//     OUTSIDE this is indistinguishable from case 1 by error value alone,
//     so this function checks platform.IsPermanent on the error the fetch
//     closure itself returned, BEFORE it ever reaches platform.Retry's own
//     unwrapping (platform.IsPermanent's own doc comment explains why it
//     must be checked there and not on Retry's own return value). Routine
//     workspace member churn, not evidence the fetch API is broken --
//     deliberately NEITHER logged NOR counted, exactly like case 2.
