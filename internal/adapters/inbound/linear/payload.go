// This file's types mirror the REAL fields of Linear's own
// AgentSessionEventWebhookPayload GraphQL object (and the AgentSession/
// AgentActivity "*WebhookPayload" child types it embeds), fetched
// directly from Linear's own live, current SDL schema
// (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linear/linear/refs/heads/master/
// packages/sdk/src/schema.graphql, linked from Linear's own developer
// docs as the authoritative reference) during this Step's investigation
// -- not guessed. Only the fields this package actually reads are
// declared; encoding/json silently ignores every field Linear's real
// payload carries that isn't listed here, so this intentionally stays
// narrow rather than mirroring the schema exhaustively.

// agentSessionEventWebhookPayload is the top-level webhook body for
// Linear's own "AgentSessionEvent" category (Linear-Event header ==
// agentSessionEventType).

	// event whose AgentActivity.Signal == "stop" (see webhook.go).

	// Type is AgentSessionEventWebhookPayload's own "type of resource"
	// field -- expected to equal agentSessionEventType too, checked

	// since it is available before the body is even parsed).
