SCOPE NOTE: §6.3 names the full BFF-facing route surface (sessions, events, artifacts, secrets, environments, automations, uploads, ws-token) but only sessions, events, artifacts, and ws-token are specified in enough field-level detail anywhere in the technical plan to schema honestly today (Step 19's own plan row: 'REST endpoints the UI needs (create/get/events/artifacts)'). Secrets/environments/automations/uploads DTOs are deliberately NOT modeled here — they belong to the PRs that define those features (environments: PR-10/26/27; automations: PR-46/47; uploads: PR-49). This is a scope decision, not an oversight (see contracts/README.md). These 5 shapes are independent named payloads, not a discriminated union, so there is deliberately no top-level oneOf. Field nullability convention: 'nullable' means a required key whose value may be JSON null. Enums here MUST match the Postgres enums in migrations/000004_sessions.up.sql exactly.
