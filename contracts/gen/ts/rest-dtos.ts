Secrets/environments/automations/uploads DTOs are deliberately NOT modeled here — they belong to the PRs that define those features (environments: PR-10/26; automations: PR-46/47; uploads: PR-49). This is a scope decision, not an oversight (see contracts/README.md). These 3 shapes are independent named payloads, not a discriminated union, so there is deliberately no top-level oneOf. Field nullability convention: 'nullable' means a required key whose value may be JSON null. Enums here MUST match the Postgres enums in migrations/000004_sessions.up.sql exactly.
